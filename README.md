## Types of Pointers
- DataType Pointers (int,float pointers)
- Null Pointers (int *p = NULL)
- Function Pointers (stores reference to functions, used to pass function as arguments)
- Void Pointers (requires type casting before accesing value)
- Dangling Pointers (when the refrenced memory location is deallocated, pointer becomes dangling pointer)
